Introduction: Rumination is a persistent way of thinking in which one dwells on awful information, often from the past or present, resulting in emotional misery (Sansone & Sansone, 2012) without any resolution. It is repeating the same thoughts, which usually are sad or dark. This is dangerous to your mental health because it can intensify depression and anxiety and impair your ability to think and process emotions. It may also lead you to feel isolated and can push people away. Rumination is common among perfectionists, neurotics, anxious and those who excessively focus on their relationships with others.  '
